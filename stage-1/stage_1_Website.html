      <p> <b>NURBS (non-uniform rational B-splines) are mathematical representations that can
        accurately model any shape from a simple 2D line, circle, arc, or box to the most
        complex 3D free-form organic surface or solid. Because of their flexibility and accuracy,
        NURBS models can be used in any process from illustration and animation to manufacturing.</b>

      <h2 id="curveGeometry">Curve Geometry</h2>
      <p><b>Since curves are geometric objects, they possess a number of properties or characteristics
        which can be used to describe or analyze them. For example, every curve has a starting coordinate
        and every curve has an ending coordinate. When the distance between these two coordinates is zero,
        the curve is closed. Also, every curve has a number of control-points, if all these points are located
        in the same plane, the curve as a whole is planar. Some properties apply to the curve as a whole, while
        others only apply to specific points on the curve. For example, planarity is a global property while
        tangent vectors are a local property. Also, some properties only apply to some curve types. So far we’ve
        discussed some of Grasshopper’s Primitive Curve Components such as: lines, circles, ellipses, and arcs.</b>

      <br>
      <br>
      <p> Degree: The degree is a positive whole number. This number is usually 1, 2, 3 or 5, but can be any
        positive whole number. The degree of the curve determines the range of influence the control points have
        on a curve; where the higher the degree, the larger the range. NURBS lines and polylines are usually degree 1,
         NURBS circles are degree 2, and most free-form curves are degree 3 or 5.
      </p>

      <p>Control Points: The control points are a list of at least degree+1 points. One of the easiest ways to change the
        shape of a NURBS curve is to move its control points.
      </p>

      <p>Weight: Control points have an associated number called a weight . Weights are usually positive numbers.
        When a curve’s control points all have the same weight (usually 1), the curve is called non-rational, otherwise the
        curve is called rational. Most NURBS curves are non-rational. A few NURBS curves, such as circles and ellipses, are always rational.
      </p>

      <p>Knots: Knots are a list of (degree+N-1) numbers, where N is the number of control points.</p>

      <p>Edit Points: Points on the curve evaluated at knot averages. Edit points are like control points except they are always located
        on the curve and moving one edit point generally changes the shape of the entire curve (moving one control point only changes the
        shape of the curve locally). Edit points are useful when you need a point on the interior of a curve to pass exactly through a certain location.

      <h2 id="surfaceGeometry">Surface Geometry</h2>
      <p><b>Apart from a few primitive surface types such as spheres, cones, planes and cylinders, Rhino supports three kinds of freeform surface types,
        the most useful of which is the NURBS surface. Similar to curves, all possible surface shapes can be represented by a NURBS surface, and this is
        the default fall-back in Rhino. It is also by far the most useful surface definition and the one we will be focusing on.</b>
        <br>

        <img src="http://i1195.photobucket.com/albums/aa395/phil_pidis/1-5-1_001-primitives.png" alt=" photo 1-5-1_001-primitives.png"/>
        <br>
        <br>
        NURBS surfaces are very similar to NURBS curves. The same algorithms are used to calculate shape, normals, tangents, curvatures and other properties,
        but there are some distinct differences. For example, curves have tangent vectors and normal planes, whereas surfaces have normal vectors and tangent planes.
        This means that curves lack orientation while surfaces lack direction. In the case of NURBS surfaces, there are in fact two directions implied by the geometry,
        because NURBS surfaces are rectangular grids of {u} and {v} curves. And even though these directions are often arbitrary, we end up using them anyway because they make life so much easier for us.

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Surface Domain A surface domain is defined as the range of (u,v) parameters that evaluate into a 3-D point on that surface. The domain in each dimension (u or v)
        is usually described as two real numbers (u_min to u_max) and (v_min to v_max) Changing a surface domain is referred to as reparameterizing the surface.In Grasshopper,
        it is often useful to reparameterize NURBS surfaces so that the u and v domains both range from 0 to 1. This allows us to easily evaluate and operate on the surface.

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Surface evaluation Evaluating a surface at a parameter that is within the surface domain results in a point that is on the surface. Keep in mind that the middle of the
        domain (mid-u, mid-v) might not necessarily evaluate to the middle point of the 3D surface. Also, evaluating u- and v-values that are outside the surface domain will not
        give a useful result.

      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Normal Vectors and Tangent Planes The tangent plane to a surface at a given point is the plane that touches the surface at that point. The z-direction of the tangent plane
        represents the normal direction of the surface at that point.Grasshopper handles NURBS surfaces similarly to the way that Rhino does because it is built on the same core of
        operations needed to generate the surface. However, because Grasshopper is displaying the surface on top of the Rhino viewport (which is why you can’t really select any of
        the geometry created through Grasshopper in the viewport until you bake the results into the scene) some of the mesh settings are slightly lower in order to keep the speed
        of the Grasshopper results fairly high. You may notice some faceting in your surface meshes, but this is to be expected and is only a result of Grasshopper’s drawing settings.
        Any baked geometry will still use the higher mesh settings.</p>
